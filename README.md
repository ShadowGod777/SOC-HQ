# SOC-HQ
My first home-built SIEM project using Wazuh, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.
=======
# 🛡️ SOC HQ – My First SIEM Stack (Wazuh + Elasticsearch + Kibana)

This is a personal project I started to help myself better understand Security Operations Center (SOC) tools and concepts while pursuing my degree in Cybersecurity.

> I'm a student still learning — this isn’t a class assignment or school project. I built this from the ground up to gain hands-on experience and push myself beyond the classroom.

## 🔧 Stack Overview
- **Wazuh** – Open-source security platform for threat detection and response
- **Elasticsearch** – Stores and indexes logs for search and analysis
- **Kibana** – Data visualization and dashboard interface

## 🎯 Why I Built This
I wanted to understand how real SOC environments work: how logs are collected, rules are tuned, and alerts are triggered. This lab environment helps me experiment safely and grow my skills as I work toward my career goals.

## 🧠 What I’m Practicing
- Installing and configuring security monitoring tools
- Tuning detection rules to reduce false positives
- Building and customizing dashboards in Kibana
- Collecting logs from other computers in my network
- Planning future integrations for alerting and response

## 🧪 Work in Progress
This project is ongoing. As I learn, I’ll continue updating:
- `setup-notes.md` – installation and configuration steps
- `todo.md` – feature plans and next steps
- Any example configs or screenshots (coming soon)
